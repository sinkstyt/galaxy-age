## Technologies Used
* _html, css, javascript_
* _ESLint, Jest, and npm_
* _webpack, webpack-cli, Babel_
* _VS Code, Chrome DevTools_

## Description
* Takes in your age in years
* Takes in your selection for which planet in the Solar System to which your age will be converted
* Can also tell you a prediction of how many additional years you would expect to live on selected planet
* If you have achieved an age beyond selected planet's predicted life expectancy, the difference will be shown.
> To clarify: a Mercury year lasts 88 Earth days due to that planet's quick pace at completing a full revolution around the Sun.
> Thus one would expect one's Mercury age to be much greater than Earth age, since 88 days fits just over four times in 365.
